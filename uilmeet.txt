he road to the state track and field championships in Texas was a difficult and unforgiving one.  I am not sure if it has changed, but in the 1970s and 1980s, it started with a district track meet and then went on to a regional track meet before culminating in the championships.  In order to advance, competitors had to come in first or second place in an event.  Times and distances did not matter, only order of finish.  So, an individual or team may have arrived at a district or regional meet with the fasted posted time in the state that year, but if they had a bad day, or an injury, or a dropped baton in the district or regional meet, there was no mercy - they did not advance.  There were times when the state meet did not include individuals or teams that had posted the fasted time in the nation that year. 

One of the great track meets in my youth was the Houston Regional Track Meet - the state qualifier, then held at San Jacinto Junior College in Pasadena.  Some of the best high school track and field athletes in the country came from Texas, and this was certainly true in the Houston area, and the regional meet at "San Jac" filled the bleachers.  The track was unlike any I'd seen before, made of some type of synthetic material, instead of the standard asphalt, and was a kind of grayish white, with blue lane lines and numbers, instead of the standard black and white.  The lanes were wider that you would see at a normal high school track stadium.  And, the crowd was so large that the PA announcer would have to quiet them at the start of of every race, with an announcement that I still hear in my mind when I watch a race, even though I have never again heard it spoken, "Quiet please ... the gun is up."

Dad took Steve and me to the 1976 regional meet.  The big race that year was the mile relay.  Shortly after that time, Texas high school meets converted race distances to metric measurements and the relays became known as the "four-by-<some distance>, relay" but in 1976, the 4 x 440-yard relay was commonly and simply known as the mile relay.  It was always the last event of high school track meet, relays were scored double (i.e., 20 points for a win, instead of the 10 given for an individual victory), and teams loaded up their mile relay teams with some of their best athletes.

That year, two of the fastest teams in the country would race in the regional finals - Jesse Jones High School and James Madison High School, both from the Houston School District.  Madison would win in a thrilling race and would run the fastest time in the country that year to date in that race.  The first legs of the relay run in their individual lanes, but the second legs "cut in" about 100 yards into the their leg, and the sight of the "cut in" and watching the runners match stride-for-stride in a meet of great athletes in teams was something I will never forget seeing for the first time.  Jones lead after the first two legs, and handed off to a sophomore, who was substituting for an injured teammate. Madison's third leg was a senior, Edwin Newsome, who, although the third leg, was probably their best quarter miler.  In a blistering sprint, Newsome caught the Jones runner in the homestretch, perhaps 30 yards from the final handoff, passed him, and Madison cruised to victory on the anchor leg.  As Newsome passed the sophomore, just in front of our view from the bleachers, we could see that he said something to the other runner.  

The newspaper reporter there asked Newsome about it, and Newsome said he told the sophomore, "You're too young and inexperienced!" as he raced by.  

We walked out with the crowd as the P.A. accouncer called out the split times - Newsome's third leg was run between 45 and 46 seconds, and when this was announced, a loud cheer rolled through the crowd as we departed into the shadows of the parking lot.  

I knew my limitations as a track-and-field athlete.  I was a decent sprinter and long-jumper, but I knew that among high school athletes in the country, and therefore the Houston area, I was not one of the best or second-best athletes in any event.  So, I set my goal to one day participate in the Houston Regional meet.  I wanted to run on that track in that big meet.  I wanted to be on the starting line or at a relay handoff position to hear, "Quite please ... the gun is up."  I wanted to hear the P.A. announcer announce my "creds" in front of a large crowd ... "In lane six, 17 5A district champion from Spring Branch High School, Tom Urquhart!"

I really loved baseball, however, and it seemed that you could not participate on both the baseball and track teams in the spring.  We only had a JV and Varsity baseball team, and I was cut from the JV baseball team as a freshman, so I ran track on the freshman team.  The next year, I made the varsity baseball team, so I thought that ruled me out of running for the track team, due to overlapping practice and game/meet schedules, and as I mentioned before, it seemed to be an unwritten rule that you could not participate on both teams.  Coaches could also get a bit territorial about their teams and athletes, so trying to participate on multiple teams might also involve an unpleasant discussion with coaches.

After I made the baseball team, the track coach approached me about perhaps just participating in the long jump in certain meets when they did not conflict with baseball.  I thought it sounded like it might work, but when I approached the baseball coach, a very good coach who was building a championship team, he did not like the idea.  He did not say I could not do it, but he discouraged it, and I decided not to pursue it because I was a young player trying to earn playing time on a good baseball team, and I didn't want my participating on the track team to cause an issue.

The next year, we had a new baseball coach, and I was a more established player on the baseball team, so I approached both the track and baseball coaches about long jumping, but only late in the track season where I could have a chance to participate in the district meet, earn points for the track team in the meet, and have an outside shot of coming in first or second and advancing to the regional meet.  Both coaches were OK with the idea, so I jumped in one meet prior to the district meet and then participated in the district meet.

In short, I had not long jumped in two years and since we did not have a coach trained in the long jump, I tried to teach myself technique over about a two-to-three week period during which I was also playing baseball.  I was always pretty good about sizing up the competition.  I read newspapers and could remember names and faces well, and I figured I would at least come in the top five in the district and had an outside shot at second place.  The best jumper could jump over 23 feet, and I knew that was farther than I could go.  I jumped about 21 feet in the one competition I participated in prior to the district meet, and felt like I could improve on that with better technique, but I figured there would be a few guys between the 21 and 22 foot range.

All jumpers get three jumps to establish a mark.  The jumpers with the best eight marks then get three more jumps, and the longest of all of those six jumps is the winner.  There was a 23-foot-plus jump by the guy I thought would win.  Then, there was a jump a little over 22 feet that was the second best.  I believe I had about a high 21-foot mark early and seemed to be improving by a little bit each jump.  With one jump left, I had third place wrapped up, but was still a couple of inches short of second place.  

I knew I had to take a risk and move my starting mark on the runway - which jumpers use to calculate their steps to hit the jumping board - an inch or two forward and risk "scratching" (crossing the jumping board) to see if I could add a little distance.

I moved the mark, told myself that this jump stood between me and my dream of participating in the regional meet, hit the jumping board just right and came in second by less than an inch, as I remember. In the big scheme of things, it was not a big thing, but for me, it was one of the happiest times of my young life. I got out of the pit, listened for the result of the jump, pumped my fist, raised my arms, let out a yell, and people around thought that I'd misunderstood the result.  I was still several inches behind the winner.  I hadn't won, but I was acting like I'd won.  It was just two more points for my team than if I'd come in third, and those two points wouldn't make a difference in the team standings.  But, I knew, that it meant that I would get to jump in a meet with the "big boys," some of the best jumpers in the country, at a venue where I'd once watched athletes as little by.

Your dreams are your dreams.

I jumped in that regional meet.  There were 16 jumpers, first-and-second-place jumpers from eight districts.  The competition was held early on a Saturday morning before the running events would start.  There was only a small crowd.  I jumped about 21-and-a-half feet and came in dead last.  It was the first long jump competition in the history of United States high schools where two jumpers jumped over 25 feet.  I was a little discouraged about my jumps.  I knew I had no change of winning, but I had hoped to improve on my personal record.  I certainly didn't want to come in last place.  However, I met some good guys among my fellow jumpers and we kind of watched in awe as two guys fought it out in the 25-foot range.  

I had to leave right after the competition because spring football practice was starting, and with confidence gained from successes in other sports, I had decided to start playing football again.  I figured I was good enough that the coaches would give me a shot.  On my way out of the stadium, I did one thing - something I had planned on doing for five years - I bought a shirt.  It was a white t-shirt with a logo that included a large outline of the state of Texas and words to the effect of, "UIL Region Three Track and Field Championships - San Jacinto Jr. College."  I wore the shirt often over the next year or so - until it was threadbare.

It is funny how things work out sometimes.  I believed that in my senior year of high school, I would return to that meet.  I thought I would actually qualify in some running events and return for the long jump.  The season worked out that way.  The guy who had beaten me in the district long jump returned, but was not having a great season.  Finally, he was beatable.  There were good long jumpers again in the area, but nothing like the year before  I knew I still wouldn't advance to the state meet, but I might even score points (come in 8th place or better) for my team in the regionals.  And, I also participated in running events during my senior year, training before or after baseball practice, and we had some relay teams I knew would qualify for the regional meet.  So, I knew I would get to actually run on that magic track.

In the district meet, I pulled my hamstring on my first jump in the long jump competition, and I was done. I would not return to the regional meet.  That one long-jump competition the year before was my only taste of that dream.  Believe it or not, I never really did feel bad about how that worked out.  I did feel a little bad about not getting a change to be a district champion, but I knew that even then, the regional meet was going to be the end of the road for me, and I had already been on that road.

Many years later, I laughed about the experience with my father.  I told him over the phone that it had been my dream to compete at the meet ever since he took me as a boy.  I said, 'Well, I got to be there and I saw a great athletic achievement there once again.  And, I came in dead last in the long jump."  

All he said about it was, "Son, I was never prouder of you in your life."
